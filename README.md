## Execution Instructions
1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure MySQL or another compatible SQL RDBMS is installed and running.
   - Import the required schema and sample data for `Shows`, `Subscribers`, and `WatchHistory` from the lab activity.

2. **Steps to Execute the Scripts:**
   - To execute each stored procedure: run the .sql files and the PROCEDURES will be created. CALL has been implemented as well. So, the defined procedures will be called automatically.
   - In Q1, use this command(to check whether table 'Shows' has been updated or not): 
        SELECT * FROM Shows; 
   - In Q5 A) Make sure Safe update if off, to do that you can use command:
        SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
